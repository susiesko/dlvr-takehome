THINGS TO KNOW:
* Components in /components should be mostly for display
* Components in /containers should be mostly for business logic
* tried to make it as responsive as possible; maybe this will be an app employees use on a smaller device.
* I didn't include proptypes in my project because I would have had to add a package
* I decided to use the context API for the shopping cart state
* I store the cart data in localstorage until order submission. 
* If this were a real application I would write API requests and store the orders in a DB!
* I am plenty familiar with promises but just decided to store the orders in state!
* If I were to load orders from a DB, I would use lazy and suspense on:
  * orders list
  * menu items if there were enough menu items.
* I assumed users could switch order back to 'open' from pick up (in case they clicked 'picked up' by accident)
* I want to acknowledge I have not written tests; I have familiarity with Jest, but not enough experience to show off.
